Welcome to RogCorp QUno! I hope you enjoy this new look on the classic American card game. 
The game is a piece of cake to figure out, so you'll get the hang of it pretty quickly. But 
anytime you need help, just choose Help | Contents or press F1 to conjure up this help file.
</P>

When you fire up QUno, you'll see the game board below:<BR><BR>
<IMG SRC="qunomain.gif" BORDER=0 ALT="QUno"><BR><BR>
The computer automatically shuffles the deck and deals the cards. You can see your cards in 
the lower part of the board. The deck and the current card in play are at the top of the 
board, to the left. On the right side, you'll see indicators that tell you whose turn it 
is, the color of a Wild card if one is in play, and the number of cards your computer 
opponent has left. In the upper right corner of the board, you'll see a graphic that 
represents your computer opponent.
</P>

<!-- how to play -->
<FONT SIZE=4><B>How To Play</B></FONT>
<P>
To play a card (it's always your turn first) just click the card you want to play. As you 
move your mouse over your cards, you'll get a hint as to which cards you can or can't play. 
If you can't play any of your cards, click the deck to draw a card. (You can also press 
Ctrl+D to draw.) After you've taken your turn, click your opponents' face to make the 
computer play. (You can also press F5 to make the computer take its turn.) Just keep 
clicking away until you've won!  After somebody wins, a new game will start automatically, 
or you can press F2 at anytime to start a new game.<BR><BR>
<B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Game menu has commands for all of the above actions. The only 
thing you can't do from the game menu is choose which card you want to play.
</P>

<!-- game rules -->
<FONT SIZE=4><B>Game Rules</B></FONT>
<P>
You all know how to play UNO&copy;. This game works just like a real two-player game. There 
are a couple things to note, however.  Skip and Reverse cards do essentially the same thing 
(because of two players). And when you play a Wild or a Wild Draw Four, you'll get this 
dialog box:<BR><BR>
<IMG SRC="qunowild.gif" BORDER=0 ALT="Wild Card"><BR><BR>
If you need a preview of each color, you'll find it conveniently placed at the bottom of 
the dialog box. Also - each player can only have ten cards in their hand, so if you reach 
ten, you'll just politely be told that you can't add anymore cards.
</P>

<!-- game options -->
<FONT SIZE=4><B>Game Options</B></FONT>
<P>
If you choose Game | Options, you'll get this friendly dialog:<BR><BR>
<IMG SRC="qunooptions.gif" BORDER=0 ALT="Options"><BR><BR>
Here is where you can configure QUno. Under "Player Options", type in your name. Under 
"Computer Options", you can give the computer a name (like maybe Loser) and you can choose 
a picture for it. You can also choose whether or not you want the computer to put on its 
thinking cap when it plays. If you want to play against a smart computer, just check the 
"Intelligent" checkbox. 
</P>

<!-- getting help -->
<FONT SIZE=4><B>Getting Help</B></FONT>
<P>
If you need help playing QUno, you have a couple of options. Of course, you can press F1 to 
get the full documentation (this file). You can also press Ctrl+Q (Help | Quick Hint) to 
get a quick strategy hint (or maybe just a snide remark). Finally, Help | About has a very 
brief summary of how to play, along with information about the program.  Here's what the 
Quick Hints and About dialogs look like:<BR><BR>
<IMG SRC="qunohint.gif" ALIGN=middle BORDER=0 HSPACE=3 VSPACE=3 ALT="Quick Hint">
<IMG SRC="qunoabout.gif" BORDER=0 HSPACE=3 VSPACE=3 ALT="About"><BR><BR>
<B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You can choose whether or not to have a Quick Hint appear each time 
you start QUno. If you don't want Quick Hints, just clear the checkbox.
