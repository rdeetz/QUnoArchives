RELEASE NOTES
-------------
1. Playing QUno for a long time may cause system resources 
to be depleted.  If you experience problems after playing 
QUno for an extended period of time, simply close QUno and 
then restart.

2. If both the user and the computer have reached the 
maximum of ten cards in their hands and neither player can 
play, QUno will be "stuck" and play cannot continue.  To 
remedy this, you will need start a new game by pressing 
F2 or choosing "New Game" from the "Game" menu.

3. Depending on the installation options you choose and 
the location on your system you direct QUno to be installed, 
the HTML online help file may not be found.  To find the 
help file, simply browse for it when prompted.  This will 
be the only time you will have to follow the above 
procedure.
